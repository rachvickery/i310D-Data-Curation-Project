# i310D-Data-Curation-Project
In this assignment, my primary objective was to craft a meaningful and informative graph from the ground up, adhering closely to the principles of reproducible research. I had the creative freedom to select and gather data of my choice, allowing me to explore topics and sources that personally resonated with my research interests. Whether I opted to collect data through web scraping, APIs, or surveys, the emphasis remained on my capacity to apply best practices that ensured the reproducibility of my research process. By creating that informative graph from scratch, I not only had the opportunity to showcase my data collection and analysis skills but also to demonstrate my ability to meticulously document my research journey. This assignment served as a valuable exercise in transparency and reproducibility, essential qualities in the realm of open scientific research.
